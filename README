The tests for this gem are located in spec/rockonruby - cd into that folder and run 'runtests.sh'

Rockonruby is a working Rails 4 application using Routesfordummies - to run it, run 'startup.sh'

Then browse to http://localhost:3002

This site, showing how to use the routesfordummies gem, is also at http://rockonruby.com

To run runtests.sh or startup.sh, you need to set environment RAILS_ROOT to the folder where Rails is installed.

Eg. if it is set to ~/rails-4.0.0.beta,
$ export RAILS_ROOT=~/rails-4.0.0.beta 
When you 
$ ls $RAILS_ROOT
you should see something like this:
Gemfile			RELEASING_RAILS.rdoc	activemodel		guides			railties
Gemfile.lock		Rakefile		activerecord		install.rb		tasks
RAILS_VERSION		actionmailer		activesupport		load_paths.rb		tools
README.rdoc		actionpack		ci			rails.gemspec		version.rb

(see config/application.rb and spec/rockonruby/spec/spec_helper.rb for the use of ENV['RAILS_ROOT'])
